					<h1>Our History</h1>
				</div>
				<div class='panel-body'>
					<p>This one time at band camp... Summer 2008, there was a little drummer boy who was the whitest and nerdiest person on the marching field. Then there was a clarinet player who was opposite in nature. She was energetic, outgoing, and just all around... um... CRAZY. Throughout high school they hung around the same group of people and talked as acquaintances.</p>
					<p>But their spark kindled in 2012, the not so little drummer boy's senior year. Their mutual friend, Jazzica, asked them both to meet at this taco joint. They agreed, traded contact information, and things started rolling. It got to a point where they would see each other every day. The drummer boy wanted someone to hang out with and go see a movie. He asked her if she would pay for the movie and he would pay for dinner. Their mind went separate ways. The drummer boy thought he was just going to chill with a friend. BUT, the crazy gal thought that this was a first date. They ate a nice meal and the drummer boy pays. They stayed and talked for a while but keeping an eye on time.<img src='img/cute.jpg' alt="Cute" class="img-thumbnail" width='50%' height='50%' style='float:right;'> They left in plenty of time to get to the theater. They walk up to the ticket booth and then walked inside. Now the drummer boy was confused. There was no currency exchange of any kind, just 'Hey I want to see this movie.' and 'Ok here you are.' She then told him that she works there and that they get free tickets. The drummer boy realized he just got cheated on for a free meal. But he did not mind. He felt something between them that he did not have with his previous friends that were girls.</p>
					<p>Through out that summer, they spent more and more time together. She went out of state for a vacation, and thats when the drummer boy realized he misses his best friend. He wanted to call and text her every moment he got but did not want to seem like he was attached. Even though the girl had an amazing time with her guy best friend, she still missed that drummer boy at home. She was going to arrive back home with out a ride, so the drummer boy offered to take her home. He picks her up and takes her home. She describes how amazing her vacation was while he was thinking he was just glad she was home and safe.</p>
					<p>They get to her place and she was worn out. She laid on the couch while he sat next to her. She had this smirk on her face that the drummer boy had never seen before. He was confused and asked 'What is it?' She replies 'Let me tell you a secret. Lean in close.' Being curious he leans in and before he realized what was going on their lips met. He was in shock but he was thinking that he already spends all his free time with this sneaky, crazy, short person, and he finally pops the first question 'Will you go out with me?'</p>

					<h1>The Unexpected Question</h1>
				</div>
				<div class='panel-body'>
					<p>Christmas Eve, the day the CRAZIES take pictures with the man in the red suit. Being the drummer boy's holiday he was invited. They both were dressed in their Sunday best because the mama bear said so. Little did the crazy gal know, the drummer boy and mama bear conspired an unexpected plot. Later that evening the couple went to dinner with the Captain and his crew. After they ate their grub they sailed forth through the lights of the holiday. It was getting late and the couple had plans to meet up with the crazies. They walk in with the smell of Christmas in the air. Mama bear starts passing out candles and seating everyone in a circle. Little did the clueless girl know mama bear and the drummer boy's conspiracy was unraveling. This was the drummer boy's first time so mama bear explains.<img src='img/surprise.jpg' alt="Cute" class="img-thumbnail" width='50%' height='50%' style='float:right;'> 'Drummer boy I want you to sit on your girl's left side. Papa bear I want you to sit on her right. Now crazy gal, you start off by saying how papa bear lights up your world, then light his candle. This keeps going till everyone's candle is lit.' Their were cameras and videos taken since mama bear loves pictures, the clueless girl did not expect anything out of the ordinary. It was drummer boy's turn to explain why his world is so bright. 'Little clueless girl, you are not only my girlfriend but my best friend. You have been there through all of my ups and downs and will you please stand up.' At this point in time the clueless girl started to put the puzzle pieces together. She was shocked when he got down on one knee and pulled out a little box. Inside this little box was something priceless. As he opens the box he says, 'Will you marry me?' The not so clueless girl starts to get bubbly and looks away while it was all happening. She eventually says 'YES.' As the night went on they told the world the good news.</p>
